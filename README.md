# List module

This is a private list module wirtten for use within my projects to make using lists of data easier.

## Description

This list data structure is focused on ease-of-use for use within my projects.

## Quickstart

You can quite easily boot this project by compiling it with g++. For personal ease-of-use I included a unix shell script file that will compile this for me.


`bash compile.sh`


If you want run the tests simply run


`bash tests.sh`

## TODO

- Add more tests as I add more functionality
- Add the ability to handle multiple data types
